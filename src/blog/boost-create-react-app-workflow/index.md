title: Boost your create-react-app workflow with esbuild / swc

We can see a trend of replacing the current javascript tooling with faster tools written in go / rust. In this post I decided to try [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) and [swc](https://swc.rs/) to see what performance improvement we can get in any application using create-react-app.

Internally create-react-app uses webpack to create a bundle for our application. In your code you use some ECMAScript features that are not yet available in all browsers (eg: async / await). Babel is used to compile the javascript / typescript files of your application in a backwards compatible version of javascript, meaning it can be used in older browser versions. We can speed up this process by internally **replacing babel with esbuild / swc** which are faster alternatives.

As your app is growing, the development environment and compilation is getting slower and slower, it can easily reach 10+ mins for the build time üê¢. To improve build time and ship code faster to production you might be interested in using these tools and get:

- Faster loading time in development
- Faster build time
- Faster tests

While writing this post I created 2 projects [create-react-app-swc](https://github.com/pradel/create-react-app-swc) and [create-react-app-esbuild](https://github.com/pradel/create-react-app-esbuild) to help you integrate either swc or esbuild easily in your application.

_While these tools are focused on the create-react-app tooling, you can take a look at the source code and integrate them in your own webpack configuration._

### What are these tools and why are they faster?

#### Esbuild

[esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) is a super-fast javascript/typescript bundler and minifier written in Go. `esbuild` also provides a javascript minifier to replace [terser](https://github.com/terser/terser).

#### Swc

[swc](https://swc.rs/) is a super-fast javascript/typescript compiler written in Rust. In the future you will be able to use swc to check your typescript files. swc is also creating their own webpack alternative called [spack](https://swc.rs/docs/usage-spack-cli).

## Benchmark

I added both approaches to one of my typescript application to see what are the results.

- default create-react-app build time: [2m 16s](https://github.com/pradel/twoblocks/runs/1242465589?check_suite_focus=true)
- esbuild build time: [1m 00s](https://github.com/pradel/twoblocks/runs/1242471386?check_suite_focus=true)
- swc build time: [1m 12s](https://github.com/pradel/twoblocks/runs/1242474018?check_suite_focus=true)

For a pretty small project, we can see that the build time is faster. For esbuild we can see that our build is **more than 2x faster**.
esbuild is currently faster than swc as it also includes a minifier, so we can replace the default terser minifier with it.

If you are trying this on a bigger project I would love to know the results you get!
